title: About SETI.news
---

Academic research on the [Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence) (SETI) is sometimes considered taboo, and thus is [scattered](http://sites.psu.edu/astrowright/2015/07/25/what-is-the-h-index-of-seti/) among many research journals and outlets. It can also be difficult to distinguish online between actual academic research and wild speculation or conspiracy theories.


This newsletter was started in January 2016 as an attempt to aggregate and disseminate legitimate academic SETI research to the community. We will only include academic articles or blog posts with relevant observations or testable theories related to SETI. Note this doesn't include general astrobiology, as there are now multiple appropriate research journals devoted to that topic. Spam, abject speculation, hoaxes, and conspiracy theory will also not be included.


SETI.news is not a research journal, and is not affiliated with any other organization, including the SETI Institute, NASA, the National Science Foundation, nor any public or private university.
