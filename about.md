Academic research on the [Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence) (SETI) is sometimes considered taboo, and thus is [scattered](http://sites.psu.edu/astrowright/2015/07/25/what-is-the-h-index-of-seti/) among many research journals and outlets. It can also be difficult to distinguish online between actual academic research and wild speculation or conspiracy theories.

This newsletter was started in January 2016 as an attempt to aggregate and disseminate legitimate academic SETI research to the community.
