title: 2016 MAY Mailing
---

The 2016 May mailing of SETI.news is out! [View this mailing](http://us6.campaign-archive1.com/?u=d896005c207438af0297357d5&id=2ffe41058a)

<br>

**Fun fact:**
The most popular article from *last* month's mailing was: ["Type III Societies (Apparently) Do Not Exist" (B. Lacki)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07844)

The newsletter is slowly growing in readership. Please help spread the word and post about SETI.news on your social media platforms. This will ensure we meet our 2 primary goals:

1. Get submissions/records of all new SETI research
2. Spread the word about academic SETI research to all interested researchers
