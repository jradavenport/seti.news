title: 2017 MAR Mailing
---

[The 2017 March mailing of SETI.news is out!](http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=d896005c207438af0297357d5&id=f8e8dc6354)

The email list has now reached 70 subscribers!

Note: "April Fools" articles related to SETI will not be included in the email newsletter. However, I will note the one that caught my attention this year: [A revolution is brewing: observations of TRAPPIST-1 exoplanetary system fosters a new biomarker](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10803), and shamelessly link to my 2013 semi-serious April Fools paper: [Unidentified Moving Objects in Next Generation Time Domain Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7433)
