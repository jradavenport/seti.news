<p>The email list has now reached 70 subscribers!</p>

<p>Note: “April Fools” articles related to SETI will not be included in the email newsletter. However, I will note the one that caught my attention this year: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10803">A revolution is brewing: observations of TRAPPIST-1 exoplanetary system fosters a new biomarker</a>, and shamelessly link to my 2013 semi-serious April Fools paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7433">Unidentified Moving Objects in Next Generation Time Domain Surveys</a></p>
