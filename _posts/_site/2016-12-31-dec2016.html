<p>This marks 1 full year of mailings from SETI.news! The list has grown to nearly 60 subscribers.</p>

<p>The biggest conversation for SETI research this year was the discovery of unexplained variability from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852">KIC 8462852</a>, also known as “Boyajian’s Star”, first announced in 2015. We expect much more interest in this object, and searches for similar outliers in large surveys, in 2017!</p>

<p>If you see any SETI articles we missed posting this year (perhaps ones that didn’t get listed on the arXiv), please let us know by reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/jradavenport">J. Davenport</a>.</p>
