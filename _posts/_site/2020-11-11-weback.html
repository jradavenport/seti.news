<p>Hello SETI.news fans! We had a couple mailings in 2019 of the newsletter, and some catch-up issues in early 2020, but ran in to 2 problems:</p>

<p>1) the scripts to generate and update this website broke in late 2018, and</p>

<p>2) the administrator ran out of time to fix the website <em>or</em> update the newsletter for much of 2019 and 2020 for… lots of reasons.</p>

<p>So welcome back - Take a look at all the back-issues of <a href="https://us6.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=d896005c207438af0297357d5&amp;id=8caf9a6589">the newsletter here!</a></p>

<p>We hope SETI.news will be back to regular monthly operations in 2021, and are collaborating with Jason Wright’s group and their <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/astrowright/2015/07/25/what-is-the-h-index-of-seti/0">SETI ADS Library</a> to make curating this site easier for all! Part of that effort is fixing and re-launching this website version. Please <a href="http://twitter.com/jradavenport">let me know</a> if there are any issues.</p>
