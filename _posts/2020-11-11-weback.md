title: We're Back!
---

Hello SETI.news fans! We had a couple mailings in 2019 of the newsletter, and some catch-up issues in early 2020, but ran in to 2 problems:

1) the scripts to generate and update this website broke in late 2018, and

2) the administrator ran out of time to fix the website *or* update the newsletter for much of 2019 and 2020 for... lots of reasons.

So welcome back - Take a look at all the back-issues of [the newsletter here!](https://us6.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=d896005c207438af0297357d5&id=8caf9a6589)

We hope SETI.news will be back to regular monthly operations in 2021, and are collaborating with Jason Wright's group and their [SETI ADS Library](https://sites.psu.edu/astrowright/2015/07/25/what-is-the-h-index-of-seti/0) to make curating this site easier for all! Part of that effort is fixing and re-launching this website version. Please [let me know](http://twitter.com/jradavenport) if there are any issues.
