[The 2016 December mailing of SETI.news is out!](http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=d896005c207438af0297357d5&id=b2057541f1)

This marks 1 full year of mailings from SETI.news! The list has grown to nearly 60 subscribers.

The biggest conversation for SETI research this year was the discovery of unexplained variability from [KIC 8462852](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852), also known as "Boyajian's Star", first announced in 2015. We expect much more interest in this object, and searches for similar outliers in large surveys, in 2017!

If you see any SETI articles we missed posting this year (perhaps ones that didn't get listed on the arXiv), please let us know by reaching out to [J. Davenport](https://twitter.com/jradavenport).
